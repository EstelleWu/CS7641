Hi, welcome to look at my analysis on supervised learning using 5 models. Here is the instruction:

1. Download pyton 3.7 and jupyter
2. Download libraries: numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, scikit-optimize 
3. Once you open the notebook, you should be able to run all the cells/code

The code and analysis can be found here: https://github.com/EstelleWu/CS7641/tree/main/A1
